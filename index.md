# Exploiting (D)COM in C. CobaltStrike BOF as PoC.
As a junior Redteamer I wanted to learn more about (D)COM. Turned out that mostly (D)COM is abused using Powershell, C#, and C++. Now, it is possible to write a BOF using C++ but I thought it will be more interesting if I try C, and it worked! We will use MMC20.Application in the demo although the PoC uses ShellWindows. This is intentional because the concepts cannot be all explained in one PoC. If you go through this writeup then understanding the PoC should not be a difficult task.
The COM Basics together with a demo is covered in a YouTube video (TBD). 



## General Workflow
1. Initialize COM
2. Find the CLSID for MMC20.Application class
3. Find the IID for the interface that declares the method we want to invoke
4. Create an instance (object) of the MMC20.Application class
5. Get a pointer to the interface implementing the method you want to invoke
6. Get the ID of the method you want to invoke
7. Invoke it

Let's break them down one at a time...

1. Initialize COM
This is pretty much standard. The function to use is CoInitialize, and NULL must be passed as an argument for it. You may also use CoInitializeEx, but CoInitialize will do.
```C
HRESULT CoInitialize(NULL);
```




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Yaxser/CobaltStrike-BOF/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Yaxser/CobaltStrike-BOF/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
